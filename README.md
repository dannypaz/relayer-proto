#### Getting started

Install NVM and run `nvm install 8` to pick up the latest LTS version of node (we will be upgrading to 10 in the future)

After nvm is installed, use `nvm use` to switch to the current node version for this project.

Install dependencies w/ `npm i` and then build the project with `npm run build`. The former command will initialize the protocol buffers for LND and Relayer as well as run tests against the project to make sure everything is setup properly

After all of these steps! You can finally run `docker-compose up -d`

### Development

You will need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for our setup.

- To view logs you can use `docker-compose logs <container_name> --follow`
- To run tests, use `npm test`

##### Ports that are exposed to the host (through docker)

```
localhost:50078 # Relayer
localhost:27017 # MongoDB
```

### Terminology

- Server - gRPC server
- Implementations - action handlers for events provided by gRPC proto
- Service - gRPC service
- Relayer Events - any action that is triggered by implementations
- Relayer Subscriptions - client hooks for actions emitted by the relayer

### Additional Notes

- All amounts come into the application as a string that represented a 64 bit integer. In order to support this in JS (js support is weird for 64 bit numbers) we use BigInteger AND mongoose long (64 type)

### IMPORTANT ABOUT SSL:

- Node GRPC does not support the same certs that are generated by LND, so we have to modify the lnd_btc.sh script to accomadate this
- lnd_btc needs to listen on port `0.0.0.0` for RPC or is will never reach out of the docker container
- There are GRPC_SSL_CIPHER lists that need to be updated for grpc to recongnize the certs used by LND#

```
Beware that lnd autogenerated certificates are not compatible with current NodeJS gRPC module implementation.

Lnd uses the P-521 curve for its certificates but NodeJS gRPC module is only compatible with certificates using the P-256 curve (link).

You need to generate your own lnd certificates using the following commands (thanks to Alex Akselrod for helping me on this):

# Enter the Lnd home directory, located by default at ~/.lnd on Linux or
# /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Lnd/ on Mac OSX
# $APPDATA/Local/Lnd on Windows. Also change '/CN=localhost/O=lnd' to '//CN=localhost\O=lnd' if you are using Git Bash.
cd ~/.lnd
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out tls.key
openssl req -new -sha256 -key tls.key -out csr.csr -subj '/CN=localhost/O=lnd'
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 36500 -key tls.key -in csr.csr -out tls.cert
rm csr.csr
```
